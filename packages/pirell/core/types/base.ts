// lets a prior op's Raw<In> output satisfy the next op's DataOf<In> param
// with zero cast (PLAN.md: brand-removal). The [unknown] extends
// [DataOf<S>] guard covers S=[]/["..."]: `unknown & X` collapses to X, and
// a primitive return value has no properties in common with a bare
// optional-key object — so with no shape claim, Raw<S> stays unbranded
// unknown rather than an unsatisfiable object type.

// Every op's data param carries its own In claim, enforced by ordinary TS
// parameter-type checking at any call site — type checking, not runtime
// checking: authoring is a plain JS function plus an annotation, no factory,
// no wrapper. The strict MatchData lattice (mixed-vs-leaf and friends) still
// lives at the compose/pipe gate (ComposeGate→CheckData); a future pass will
// relax compose now that the raw claim is per-function. Detours removed: a
// checked() wrapper (added an import), a generic <D>-surface Op with a
// rest-tuple gate (authoring either needed a makeOp factory or lost body
// typing), and an intersecting generic param (TS decomposes intersection
// sources during inference; conditional-on-D verdicts were
// directory-state-sensitive). __pirell brand is gone; thunk-vs-plain-fn
// discrimination is structural (arity), handled in compose.ts — see PLAN.md.
